DoomNukem3D is two projects of 42, the french programming school, in one
The first Wolf3D use Raycasting to render 2D map in bird view into a 3D labyrinth.
   This is made by the Raycasting method originally used for the Game Wolfenstein3D
   We pushed it a little further including
   - Music
   - Items
   
The second DoomNukem is an highly improved version of the first version of the project.
In fact, it is a complete game, where there are :
  - Ennemies
  - An item menu
  - A HUD
  - Weapons
  - A map creator programm
  - Animations
  - A scenario
  
The project is actually in its early stage.
