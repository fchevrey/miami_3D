Wolf3D is a 42 school's project that use Raycasting to render 2D map in bird view into a 3D labyrinth.
   This is made by the Raycasting method originally used for the Game Wolfenstein3D.
   We pushed it a little further including
   - Music
   - sound effect
   - HUD
   - FPS movement (wasd + mousemotion)
   - collision
   - TGA file parser
